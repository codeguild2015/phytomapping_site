# Phytomap #
My capstone project for the PDX Code Guild Fall 2015 cohort.  The site built with botanists, naturalists, phytochemists and other botanically minded people, be they hobbyists or professionals.
The site allows a user to click on a map (using the LeafletJS API) and save botanical/mycological specimens locations as well as their scientific binomial names, descriptions and pictures.  A list of specimens is displayed next to the map and upon clicking on a siting the user is redirected to a detail page that utilizes a scraper which returns natural products isolated from the species in question as well as a pie chart (rendered with ChartJS) showing a graphical breakdown of the compounds by their chemical class (Glycosides, Terpenes, Flavanoids, Amines, Acids).
